                                Separate Selenium and Playwright suites existed per product,
                                each with different conventions and levels of maintenance.

                                Test runs were long and flaky, so teams only ran them for
                                “big” releases — and incidents still slipped through.

                                Defined <strong>golden journeys</strong> for web — sign-up, login,
                                search, cart, checkout, key forms — as the backbone.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Standardised a single automation stack with shared page objects,
                                helpers and patterns across squads.

                            <li>
                                Introduced tiers of suites (smoke, sanity, full regression)
                                mapped to CI stages and environments.

                            <li>
                                Added tags (e.g. <code>@payments</code>, <code>@critical</code>) to
                                enable targeted runs when only certain modules changed.

                                regression runs on main branches and pre-prod.

                                Pushed results into dashboards (trend of pass rate, duration,
                                flaky tests) that were reviewed in stand-ups.

                            <li>
                                Introduced a simple “test ownership” model — each critical
                                journey had a clear squad owning its stability.

                                Teams gained confidence to ship more frequently because
                                critical web journeys were always covered.
