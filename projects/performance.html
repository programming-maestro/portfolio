<ul>
<li>Simulated HTTPS load using JMeter Distributed (Controller-Worker setup) and used custom listeners for throughput, latency, and error visualizations.</li>
<li>Developed Locust-based scripts for TPS and concurrency benchmarking and dockerized them for distributed execution.</li>
<li>Designed tailored CRUD operations to benchmark database latency and throughput across multiple database engines.</li>
<li>Simulated large data ingestion and UI flows for report-volume load testing; reduced frontend report load-time by 27%.</li>
