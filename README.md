🚀 Chetan Maikhuri — Portfolio Website

Quality Engineering Leader | SDET Architect | Release & Performance Engineering

This repository hosts my personal professional portfolio website, built to showcase my experience, projects, and engineering philosophy across Quality Engineering, Automation, Performance Testing, and Release Governance.

The site is intentionally designed as a lightweight, dependency-free static website to demonstrate strong fundamentals in web engineering, analytics instrumentation, SEO, and performance — not just UI presentation.
